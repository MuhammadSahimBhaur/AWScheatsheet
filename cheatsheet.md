# AWS Setup

When starting off we create a root account. Using the root account we create an IAM account and give ourselves access. 

We can give ourselves "User and Role Access to Billing Information";
1. Click the edit button on the right
2. Click "Activate IAM Access"

### User Groups

Creating user groups allows for easier allocation of pollicies. We can also create custom policies.
